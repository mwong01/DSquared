# 🤔DSquared - Decisions, Decisions🤔 

Let's face it: decision making is hard. <b>Very hard</b>. That's why we created <i><b>Decisions, Decisions</b></i>. Bring some <b>consensus</b> to your event planning and let your peeps rank their fave choices. Get the results, share with your circle, and become the cool person in your group who brought democracy to life!

DSquared is a decision maker app that does the hard work of deciding easy for you and your family/friends/co-workers. 

We built this app using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and utilizing AJAX front-end skills. We also used Node and Express server-side.
